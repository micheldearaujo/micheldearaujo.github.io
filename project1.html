									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>During my childhood, for various reasons, my family always had to move constantly. Today, at 23, I have moved 12 times and counting.
										It was practically once every two years. This lifestyle can have its upsides, such as always meeting new places, new people,
										new experiences and getting out of the box when discovering that the world is much more than it appears. However, always moving
										home brings with it some unwanted hassles, such as always spending money on furniture shipping, dealing with broken furniture in transportation,
										and finding good schools for the children (this part is quite difficult from my experience!). In addition to all of this, there is the difficult task of finding the perfect property,
										or at least close to perfection, that offers everything you are looking for combined with a fair price - the famous cost-benefit. Factors such as size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
										parking spaces and especially the location greatly affect the price of a house or apartment. At 22 I decided to leave my family's house and gather the rags with my girlfriend,
										and that's when I came across with all the difficulties and concerns that a child can't imagine. It was based on this that I decided to do this project, to get to know a little more
										about the Brazilian real estate market, not only from an economic point of view but from a practical point of view. Is it worth to rent a house with more space or is a studio apartment enough?
										Should I spend more living downtown near work where prices are higher and apartments are small, or should I spend less in a house further away? This is a very important decision to make,
										as it requires both physical and mental effort. This project is also suitable for those who have a property and want to rent it but have no idea how to price their house or apartment.
										It is possible to create a Machine Learning (ML) model to, through the data collected from properties throughout Brazil, determine, through the characteristics of your property, its rental price.</p>

									<p>This work will be constructed as follows: I will collect information about real estate via Webscraping using the Python programming language, together with the Selenium library, which allows me to
										browse web pages, interact with them and extract information. With the raw data, I will use the R language to perform all the data analysis: Cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis and construction
										of the ML model to predict the price based on the houses characteristics. I thought that a good way to carry out this analysis would be to use a common site for renting and selling real estate, because there
										individuals and brokerages advertise their products. All the rest of the analysis will be done using the R language. You will probably need to do a good job of extracting data from strings, using regular expressions and splits.</p>

									<p>This analysis will be very useful for two different audiences. The first is people in general, who are looking for a new place to live and want to make an assertive decision based on real data. Through this analysis the user will be able
										to decide which type of property suits his needs, whether it is a house or apartment, whether it is near or far from the center, large or small, etc. The second audience is made up both of people in general, who own a property and
										wish to rent it but do not know how much it is worth, and for realtors, who technically do the same, but with third-party properties. This way, the client will be able to know more assertively what the value of his property should be
										based on hundreds of other properties with similar characteristics, from the same neighborhood and from nearby neighborhoods.</p>
